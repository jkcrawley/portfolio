                    I started to get into web development in my teens, building websites on Geocities or Angelfire for my friends and I.  It was before divs, so I learned to layout websites with tables and would spiffy up the site with animated gifs I made in Photoshop.  I would also use photoshop to make graphics and avatars for friends on gaming forums. As I got older I started working in manufacturing, but I still pursued my passion in web development and eventually earned an AAS in Web Development and Programming. I continued to update my skills and develop several projects, whether it was for someone who needed a landing page or just for fun. </p>

                    <p>I've always loved technology whether it was making websites for my friends or building computers with my kids, whom I would also teach HTML and CSS.  I have experience in working with different teams in many different environments, and my time working in collections helped me develop skills in problem solving and guiding consumers through issues and finding the best course of action.</p>
